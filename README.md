# Jack Williams
Over the course of my High School career, I have grown both as an individual and as a programmer. I started focusing on Computer Science during my sophmore year of high school, and am now a Senior at Malden High School ready to enter my undergraduate in Computer Science. 

## Java programming
I took the AP CompSci course in highschool, so I have linked most of what I did relating to that class [here.](https://github.com/jackwilliams2480/SideProjects/tree/master/everythingJava)


## Resume
Here is my [Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTfWe5c8iV4pc6WFGcDPSGB4XET2uavyyUMr3Vqr4-g/edit#) if you are interested in what I did during High School.
